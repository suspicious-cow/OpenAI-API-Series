    "Here we show some representative use cases. We will use the Amazon fine-food reviews dataset for the following examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Obtaining the Embeddings\n",
    "The dataset contains a total of 568,454 food reviews Amazon users left up to October 2012. We will use a subset of 1,000 most recent reviews for illustration purposes. The reviews are in English and tend to be positive or negative. Each review has a ProductId, UserId, Score, review title (Summary) and review body (Text). For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "PRODUCT ID\tUSER ID\t        SCORE\tSUMMARY\t                TEXT\n",
    "B001E4KFG0\tA3SGXH7AUHU8GW\t5\t    Good Quality Dog Food\tI have bought several of the Vitality canned...\n",
    "B00813GRG4\tA1D87F6ZCVE5NK\t1\t    Not as Advertised\t    Product arrived labeled as Jumbo Salted Peanut...\n",
    "\n",
    "We will combine the review summary and review text into a single combined text. The model will encode this combined text and output a single vector embedding.\n"

I found Plato Natural Duck Strips and ordered a bag.  This product does not look like or smell like duck jerky strips.  My Chihuahuas sniffed it and just walked away.  It doesn\\'t even smell like duck.  Rather, it smells somewhat fishy.  A waste of my money!'"

A few hours later, we were shocked at the dog spitting up everything in this stomach- he threw up about 3 times, and then continued to spit up mucous and bile fluid. Gross, and really unfortunate :(<br /><br />I contacted both fruitables and amazon, who both graciously accepted the open bags as returns, and fruitables checked the lot numbers of the bags I had. I guess my dog had a particular sensitivity to something in these, which stinks because I really wanted him to love these nice smelling treats.<br /><br />Hopefully others have better luck with them!'"
